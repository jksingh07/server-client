# server-client
The project is a client-server system where clients can request files from the server based on various criteria like date, size, extension, and filename. The server searches for the files in its directory and returns the requested files to the client. The server, mirror, and client processes run on different machines and communicate using sockets only. The project was implemented using C programming language.
